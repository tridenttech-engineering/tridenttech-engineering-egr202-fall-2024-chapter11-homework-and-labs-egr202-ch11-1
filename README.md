# Lab 11-2 Plan and Create

1. **Read textbook pages 407 through 411. Note that your book gives instructions for setting up development tools and a development environment. Ignore those instructions. We are using Replit instead. Figure 11-48 on page 410 gives the final C++ instructions to be submitted. Please do not just copy and paste. Working through Lab 11-2 will get you used to developing, building, testing, and pushing/submitting your code**i

2. **Test the program using the same data used to desk-check the program. You can compile and run your code with the following commands:**
```
make clean
make lab11-2
./lab11-2
```
**You can also use the unit test for testing your code by running the following:** 
``` 
make test_lab11-2
./test_files/test_lab11-2
```

3. **When you are done, push your code to the Github classroom. A Github Action will grade your lab.**

# Homework 11-21

**In this exercise, you will modify the given program. The program should calculate the average stock price stored in the prices array. It then should display the average price on the screen. Complete the program using the for statement. Make the modifications and test the program appropriately.**

```
make clean
make hw11-21
./hw11-21
```
**You can also use the unit test for testing your code by running the following:** 
``` 
make test_hw11-21
./test_files/test_hw11-21
```
